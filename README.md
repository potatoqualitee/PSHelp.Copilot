# PSHelp.Copilot

PSHelp.Copilot is a PowerShell module that simplifies getting help from well-documented PowerShell modules, all using natural language and OpenAI.

To use PSHelp.Copilot, you'll need an OpenAI API key, which can be obtained by signing up for an account with OpenAI or through an OpenAI-powered service like Azure OpenAI Services.

## Features

- Convert PowerShell help documentation to an AI-friendly format
- Ask questions about a module's commands using natural language
- Get relevant answers and code examples based on the module's documentation
- Seamlessly integrate with OpenAI's API using the PSOpenAI module
- Create CustomGPTs with up to 20 files for modules without assistants
- Support for Azure OpenAI services

## Prerequisites

To use PSHelp.Copilot, you need to have the following:

- PowerShell 5.1 or higher
- An OpenAI API key (sign up at https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) or an Azure OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. Install the PSHelp.Copilot module:

   Install-Module -Name PSHelp.Copilot

2. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:

   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your_api_key_here'

## Usage

### Creating a Module Assistant

To create an assistant for a specific PowerShell module, use the `New-ModuleAssistant` command:

```powershell
New-ModuleAssistant -Module dbatools
```

This will create an assistant named "dbatools Copilot" for the `dbatools` module, allowing you to ask questions about its commands.

### Chatting with a Module Assistant

To chat with a module assistant, use the `Invoke-HelpChat` command or its alias `askhelp`:

```powershell
Set-ModuleAssistant -Module dbatools
askhelp which command can i use to encrypt a database
```

You can also use the actual `Invoke-HelpChat` command and return an object that has detailed query information:

```powershell
Invoke-HelpChat "How do I backup a database?" -As PSObject
```

By setting the default value for the `Module` or `AssistantName` parameter, you can omit it when calling `Invoke-HelpChat`. The assistant will provide relevant answers based on the module's documentation.

You can also use natural language without quotes:

```powershell
Invoke-HelpChat hey neat i dont have to use quotes bc of the way i did the parameters
```

### Setting the OpenAI Provider

To set the OpenAI provider for PSHelp.Copilot, use the `Set-OpenAIProvider` command:

```powershell
$splat = @{
    Provider   = "Azure"
    ApiKey     = "abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456"
    ApiBase    = "https://your-azure-endpoint.openai.azure.com/"
    Deployment = "your-deployment-name"
}
Set-OpenAIProvider @splat
```

This command configures the PowerShell session to use Azure OpenAI services with the provided API key, endpoint URL, and deployment name.

You can also set the provider to OpenAI:

```powershell
Set-OpenAIProvider -Provider OpenAI -ApiKey sk-abcdefghijklmno1234567890pqrstuvwxyz
```

This command configures the session to use OpenAI's services with the provided API key.

### Managing Module Assistants

PSHelp.Copilot provides several commands to manage module assistants:

- `New-ModuleAssistant`: Creates a new module assistant with specified configurations.
- `Remove-ModuleAssistant`: Removes a module assistant based on its unique ID.
- `Set-ModuleAssistant`: Sets the default module assistant for a specified module.

Here are a few examples of how to use these commands:

```powershell
# Create a new assistant for the Microsoft.PowerShell.Management module
New-ModuleAssistant -Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Management

# Remove an assistant by its ID
Remove-ModuleAssistant -Id asst_LDBDlXhNhXfWcTFIWCovjSee

# Set the default assistant for the dbatools module
Set-ModuleAssistant -Module dbatools -AssistantName "dbatools helper"
```

### Creating CustomGPTs without API Assistants

If you don't want to create an assistant but still want to leverage Custom GPTs for a module, you can use the `Split-ModuleHelp` command to split the module's help into up to 20 files:

Split-ModuleHelp -Module dbatools -OutputPath C:\temp\dbatools-help

This will split the help content of the `dbatools` module into 20 files (the default) and save them in the `C:\temp\dbatools-help` directory.

You can then use the generated files to create a CustomGPT by providing the necessary instructions. The instructions can be found in the `instructions.md` file included with PSHelp.Copilot, or you can use the example provided specifically for dbatools.

### Integration with PSOpenAI

PSHelp.Copilot seamlessly integrates with the PSOpenAI module, which provides a PowerShell interface to OpenAI's API. Make sure to set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable (`$env:OPENAI_API_KEY`) or configure the provider using `Set-OpenAIProvider` before using PSHelp.Copilot.

Or with Azure:

```powershell
$splat = @{
    Provider   = "Azure"
    ApiKey     = "abcd1234efgh5678ijkl9012mnop3456"
    ApiBase    = "https://your-azure-endpoint.openai.azure.com/"
    Deployment = "your-deployment-name"
}
Set-OpenAIProvider @splat
```

For more information about PSOpenAI and its features, refer to the [PSOpenAI README](https://github.com/mkht/PSOpenAI).

## Examples

Here are a few examples of how you can use PSHelp.Copilot:

```powershell
# Create an assistant for the Microsoft.PowerShell.Management module
New-ModuleAssistant -Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Management

# Ask a question about copying files
askhelp how can I copy files recursively?

# Ask a question about removing items
Invoke-HelpChat -Message "How do I remove a directory and all its contents?"

# Ask a question using the custom assistant
Invoke-HelpChat "How can I manage processes?"
```

## Configuration

PSHelp.Copilot provides additional configuration options to enhance the user experience and make it easier to manage OpenAI provider settings.

### Persisting OpenAI Provider Configuration

You can persist the OpenAI provider configuration to a JSON file using the `Set-OpenAIProvider` command with the `-NoPersist` switch. This allows you to save the configuration for future sessions without having to set it every time.

To persist the configuration, simply use `Set-OpenAIProvider` without the `-NoPersist` switch:

```powershell
Set-OpenAIProvider -Provider OpenAI -ApiKey "your-openai-api-key"
```

This command will save the configuration to a JSON file in the module's configuration directory.

To retrieve the persisted configuration, use the `Get-OpenAIProvider` command with the `-Persisted` switch:

```powershell
Get-OpenAIProvider -Persisted
```

This command will return the persisted configuration from the JSON file.

### Resetting OpenAI Provider Configuration

If you need to reset the OpenAI provider configuration, you can use the `Clear-OpenAIProvider` command:

```powershell
Clear-OpenAIProvider
```

This command will remove the persisted configuration file and clear the relevant entries from `$PSDefaultParameterValues`, `$global` and `$env:`, effectively resetting the configuration to a cleared state.

### Automatic Configuration on Module Import

When importing the PSHelp.Copilot module, it automatically checks for a persisted configuration file. If found, it sets the OpenAI provider configuration accordingly. If no persisted configuration is found, it checks for environment variables and sets the configuration based on those.

  BackupSecurePassword = $bkpass
  Verbose = $true
}

Start-DbaDbEncryption @splat

# use of quotes
# **DO NOT**
Test-DbaPath -SqlInstance "sql01"  -Path "C:\temp"
#**DO**:
Test-DbaPath -SqlInstance sql01  -Path C:\temp
# **DO**:
Test-Dbapath -SqlINstance sql01 -Path "C:\temp\spaces require\quotes\for example"
\```
